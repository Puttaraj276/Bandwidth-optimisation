# Bandwidth-optimisation
# need of Doing this project (Motivation): 
### In real-world applications, optimizing bandwidth allocation through base stations is highly relevant in network environments such as 5G, Wi-Fi networks, and smart cities. By ensuring that user devices connect to the base station with the maximum available bandwidth, the project improves network efficiency, reduces congestion, and enhances user experience, especially in high-density areas like airports, stadiums, or urban areas.

### The need for this project arises because, in many real-world scenarios, users experience poor connectivity due to suboptimal base station selection, leading to bottlenecks and reduced service quality. By integrating a shortest path algorithm like Dijkstra's, the project not only ensures that devices connect to the most optimal base station but also does so with minimal latency, improving both speed and reliability. This can be particularly important for applications requiring real-time data transmission like video streaming, gaming, or IoT device management.
